## üìñ Inspiration

After heartfelt conversations with our grandparents and other elderly individuals, we learned that **loneliness**, **lack of purpose**, and **cognitive decline** are among the most challenging aspects of aging. These conversations inspired us to create a compassionate, user-friendly solution that:

- Helps track cognitive and emotional health
- Facilitates meaningful connections with loved ones and peers
- Provides an engaging, accessible experience for all users

## üîß Challenges We Overcame

### Accessibility Design
Ensuring games were equally usable for both sighted and visually impaired users required extensive experimentation with audio feedback timing and clarity.

### LLM Integration
Calibrating the language model to act as a friendly, helpful "game host" without overwhelming or confusing users was a significant UX challenge that required careful prompt engineering.

### Data Visualization
Creating intuitive, non-overwhelming visual representations of cognitive trends for older users took multiple design iterations and user testing.
